# Purchase Behaviour Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes customer purchase behavior to identify loyal customers, explore demographic patterns, and discover profitable products. Key insights were derived using Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and K-means clustering.

## Key Features

### 1. Identify Most Loyal Customers & Their Spending
- Top 10 loyal customers were identified based on total sales.
- These customers exhibited high spending, indicating strong loyalty.

### 2. Find Lifestage & Premium Category Distribution of Loyal Customers
- Loyal customers were analyzed across various lifestages (e.g., young singles, families) and premium categories (premium vs budget).
- Results showed that premium customers and certain lifestages tend to demonstrate stronger loyalty.

### 3. Identify Top 3 Most Profitable Products
- The top 3 most profitable products were identified based on total sales.
- These insights highlight key revenue-generating products.

### 4. Loyal Customer Analysis
- Demographic factors such as marital and employment status were analyzed.
- Findings revealed that married and employed customers showed higher loyalty.

### 5. Customer Segmentation with K-means Clustering
Using K-means clustering, customers were segmented into four key groups:
- **Cluster 0:** Low spend, low quantity – Price-sensitive or infrequent shoppers.
- **Cluster 1:** Moderate spend, moderate quantity – Represent mainstream shoppers.
- **Cluster 2:** High spend, high quantity – Loyal or bulk buyers who drive profits.
- **Cluster 3:** Variable spend, variable quantity – Customers with varied buying habits.

## Technologies Used
- **Python Libraries:** Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
- **Clustering Algorithm:** K-means for customer segmentation

## Future Enhancements
- Incorporate more advanced clustering algorithms to improve segmentation.
- Integrate real-time dashboards for better data visualization.
- Develop personalized marketing strategies based on customer behavior insights.
